Pokedex Search app made to show ReactJS profficieny in most areas of javascript fundamentals:
- API calls
- Async functions for data fetching
- Local Storage for faster rendering
- React hooks, object destructuring, props + various React features
- Conditional rendering + Dynamic CSS elements depending on search input
- Project structuring/organised code that is easy to navigate for changes + updates
- Optimisation for viewing on mobile devices


Use the search bar on the left to find any of the original 151 pokemon by name or number, this will pull data from the pokemon public API on each result for images, stats, mooves etc. 

Clicking any of the Move buttons underneath the stats will display a modal overlay that gives a description of each.

Glad to take on any suggestions / feedback :)
